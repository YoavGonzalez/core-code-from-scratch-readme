## WEEK 1 --- TUESDAY
- Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages:   These two difer in how the console reads it, one, the compiled is translated once it is finished, meaning tat if you need to change one set of the code, you would need to go over it again and change it, whereas the interpreted, although it may use more memory, you can edit the code in a much more efficient manner, it translates the code as it goes which might be slower that thae complied, but you can edit ecah segment in a much more efficient way.
- Both, it compiled as much as it can and them it is interpreted, this is to make it faster but also efficient.
  - Start, 
  - set B = get current btc price in source
  - A = input
  - BUTTON CONVERT 
  - Convert equal C = A/B
  - print C
  - End
